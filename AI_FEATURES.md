```
1. Load database schema (tables, columns, relationships)
2. Click "Generate AI Suggestions"
3. AI analyzes schema structure and relationships
4. Receives 5-10 categorized query suggestions
5. Click any suggestion to populate the query field
```

### Features
- **Category-based suggestions**:

  "description": "Identifies your most active customers",
  "naturalLanguageQuery": "Show me the top 10 customers by number of orders",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "category": "analytics"
}

{
  "title": "Products Without Sales",

## 4. Schema Relationship Insights

### What It Does
Explains complex database relationships in business-friendly, natural language.

### When to Use
- When exploring an unfamiliar database
- To understand foreign key relationships
- For onboarding new team members
- To document your data model

### How It Works
```
1. Load database schema
2. Click "Explain Schema" (optional: select a specific table)
3. AI analyzes table relationships and structure
4. Receives natural language explanation
```

### Features
- **Full schema overview** or **table-specific** insights
- **Business-friendly language** (not just technical FK definitions)
- **Relationship explanations**:
  - How tables connect
  - The business meaning of relationships
  - Common query patterns

- **Data model structure** identification:
  - Fact tables vs. dimension tables
  - Star schema / snowflake schema detection
  - Normalized vs. denormalized areas

### Example Output
```
## Database Structure Overview

Your database follows a classic **star schema** design for sales analytics:

### Core Fact Table
**Orders** is the central fact table containing transactional data. Each order
record captures:
- Customer (FK to Customers.CustomerID)
- Product (FK to Products.ProductID)
- OrderDate, Quantity, TotalAmount

### Dimension Tables
1. **Customers** - Customer master data (names, addresses, segments)
2. **Products** - Product catalog (names, categories, prices)
3. **Employees** - Employee information (salespeople)

### Key Relationships
- **Customers → Orders**: One-to-Many (one customer can have many orders)
  - Business Meaning: Track customer purchase history
  - Common Query: "Show all orders for customer X"

- **Products → Orders**: One-to-Many (one product can appear in many orders)
  - Business Meaning: Track product sales performance
  - Common Query: "Which products sell best?"

- **Employees → Orders**: One-to-Many (one employee processes many orders)
  - Business Meaning: Track salesperson performance
  - Common Query: "Top performers by sales volume"

### Common Query Patterns
- **Customer Analytics**: JOIN Customers + Orders for purchase behavior
- **Product Performance**: JOIN Products + Orders for sales metrics
- **Sales Reporting**: JOIN all three for comprehensive dashboards
```

## 5. Smart Filters

### What It Does
Suggests useful filters based on actual data distribution and common patterns.

### When to Use
- When exploring a new table
- To find common filter categories
- For outlier detection
- To build parameterized queries

### How It Works
```
1. Select a table from the schema
2. Click "Generate Smart Filters"
3. AI samples top 100 rows from the table
4. Analyzes data distribution and patterns
5. Suggests filters with reasons
```

### Features
- **Filter types**:
  - equals (for categorical data)
  - range (for numeric/date data)
  - in (for multi-value filters)
  - like (for text search)
  - date_range (for time-based queries)

- **Data-driven**: Based on actual values in your database
- **Reason explanations**: Why each filter is useful
- **One-click apply**: Automatically adds to natural language query

### Example Suggestions
```json
[
  {
    "column": "OrderStatus",
    "filterType": "equals",
    "suggestedValue": "Shipped",
    "reason": "Most common status - useful for analyzing completed orders"
  },
  {
    "column": "OrderDate",
    "filterType": "date_range",
    "suggestedValue": "Last 30 days",
    "reason": "Recent orders are typically most relevant for analysis"
  },
  {
    "column": "TotalAmount",
    "filterType": "range",
    "suggestedValue": "> 1000",
    "reason": "High-value orders (top 10% by amount) for VIP customer analysis"
  },
  {
    "column": "Country",
    "filterType": "in",
    "suggestedValue": "USA, Canada, Mexico",
    "reason": "These 3 countries account for 80% of orders"
  }
]
```
